            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>
                To make the weather conditions readily available to people so they know how many layers to wear. We make using our site easy so no time is lost searching for what you need to know.

            <h2>Audience Description</h2>
            <p>
                This site is designed for people who need to get weather information quickly and easily.  For example, many college students are new to the area and thus unfamiliar with any of its weather patterns and would need to check a website to obtain this information. Additionally, most of them are pressed for time and need to be able to get the information they need quickly and easily, including today/tomorrow’s weather. Students are often thinking about other things than the weather, so when they do remember to check it, it could be at any time of the day. Most often this site would probably be viewed on the phone, but it could potentially be viewed on a tablet or desktop.  While this site was made with college students in mind, it is available to all as the best option for quick and easy access of weather data, always making ease of access and usability our goal.

            <h2>Peer Review - by Marwin Palea</h2>
            <p>
                Hey bro your site looks awesome. I really like your wire frames. The only critique I have is to try and expand your audience. I know this is for Rexburg and it is mostly students here, but there are a lot of families that you'll be missing out on for business. Especially if your trying to find investors. Other than that it looks great!
            </p>
            <h3>Changes made after review</h3>
            <p>
                I modified the Audience Description to include more people than just strictly college students.
