                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Demographics:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age = younger, like teens to 30's mainly</li>
                        <li>Income = moderate, though open to all ranges</li>
                        <li>Education = open to all, anyone who's interested in music</li>
                        <li>Geographic location = worldwide</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Bandcamp allows fans to easily search for and support their favorite artists.  Bandcamp also allows artists to begin making a name for themselves. From the fan point of view, it sure seemed like they kept up to speed on the mobile version of their website.</li>
                    <li>The content was very well organized to facilitate better mobile browsing. For example they enlarged the search bar on the home page, and in search results and on artists' pages the content is large enough to filter through easily even if you've just barely switched from desktop to mobile for the first time.</li>
                    <li>To make the mobile experience less painful, they enlarged the search bar (as I mentioned previously), made everything into one column (more noticeable on individual artist's pages), and made the various buttons big enough to push easily.</li>
                    <li>While I believe that they aren't aiming specifically for mobile, they do support it very well.</li>
                </ol>

                    <br>
                    Job: Junior Manager of a local grocery store<br>

                    Environment: He's very fluent in computer and phone use.  He surfs the web at least a couple hours each day.<br>

                <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>'What was the worst site you came across during the 24 hour mobile browsing experience (list it's name and url)?'<br>Times End <a href="http://www.terriblefate.com/">http://www.terriblefate.com/</a></li>
                    <li>'How did your best site differ from the worst in knowing who their target audience was?'<br> Bandcamp realized that a lot of people were probably going to look at their site on a mobile device, and they accounted for that. Time's End appartnetly didn't account for mobile users at all.</li>
                    <li>'How did your best site differ from the worst in meeting the needs of their audience?'<br> Bandcamp did a much better job then Time's End did for mobile needs, keeping all of its functions but still maintaining readability and useability.</li>
                    <li>'How did your best site differ from the worst in organizing content to facilitate it being found?'<br> Bandcamp did a really good job of moving their items around so that everything was streamlined and optimized for mobile use.  Things like resizing search bars and realigning content.</li>
                    <li>'How did your best site differ from the worst in facilitating visitors in a mobile environment?'<br> Bandcamp facilitated the mobile experience so that it was almost just as good as it is on a desktop computer while the other site's mobile UX was utterly awful.</li>
